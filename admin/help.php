<h1>How to use this peer feedback plugin</h1>
This plugin will allow your students to give anonymous and non anonmised feedback on students in their peer groups.<br />
<h2>Creating your peer feedback project</h2>
<ol>
<li>Create a peer feedback as you would a standard wordpress post or page. All settings on this page can be changed later</li>
<li>Complete the settings including the 'feedback type' i.e. written feedback, a criteria grid, or point distribution</li>
<li>After saving you will then be able to Add / Edit groups. TO do this go to the project groups page and upload a CSV with the format "Group Name, First Name, Last Name, Email address" i.e. 4 columns.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Types of feedback</h2>
<h4>Written Feedback</h4>
This is the most simple version of peer feedback and students can give written feedback in a textarea box for each student in their group. This type of feedback can be anonymous or non anonymous.
<h4>Criteria Grid (Rubic)</h4>
This type of feedback required you to upload a criteria grid as a CSV file on the project criteria edit page. You can add descriptors for each criteria / feedback question, although this is not requirement.
<h4>Point Distribution</h4>
Selecting this type of feedback allows you to give a number of points (typically 100) that students can distribute among their peers. It is recommended that you allow students to 'self-review' in this type of feedback.<br/>
Only when all points have been distributed can a student 'finalise' the feedback. Tpically with this type of feedback you do not allow students to view their feedback, as the end result is a weighting that can be applied to the final group mark for each student.

<h2>Project Phases</h2>
After you've created your peer feedback project and uploaded your groups (and criteria grid if applicable) you can then 'Launch' the project.
<h4>The Launch Phase</h4>
Once you've clicked the "Launch project" button a few things happen.<br/>
<ul>
<li>All students get emailed a unique link which they can click to give peer feedback</li>
<li>The student groups are 'locked' and you cannot upload a new group CSV file</li>
<li>Rubric Criteria (if applicable) are alos locked and cannot be changed</li>
</ul>
The feedback Phase is open until the closing date (in the project settings page) has passed, you "switch off" the project, or you "enable feedback".

<h4>Feedback Phase</h4>
After your students have finished the feedback phase you can click the 'Enable Feedback" button which does the following:
<ul>
<li>Emails all students with a unique link where they can view the feedback given from other students</li>
<li>Prevents students from giving any further feedback</li>
</ul>
